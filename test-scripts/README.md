Ok - I know there are lots of good integration test frameworks out there.  This was just thrown together to show how one might be run withn Localstack.

These tests are run when you `make local-test` in the root directory.

Alternatively you deploy locally with `make local-deploy` (in the root directory) and then run individual tests within this directory.
